This system uses GIT to manage its home directory configuration.

To synchronize changes to another computer do:

git clone https://github.com/rjmccabe3701/linux_config.git

linux_config/install.sh

----------- ZSH -----------------
I am using the oh-my-zsh "distribution" for zsh.  See https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh
To upgrade do

upgrade_oh_my_zsh

(it should also autoupdate every few weeks).

----------------------------------
To uninstall do
linux_config/uninstall.sh

Please not that user specific customization is allowed.  Please refer to
CUSTOM_CONFIG.txt for details (and an example) of how to set that up.
